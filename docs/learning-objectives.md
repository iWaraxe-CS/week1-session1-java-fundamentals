# Learning Objectives
## Java Fundamentals for .NET Developers - Week 1 Session 1

> **Clear, measurable goals** for what you will achieve in this foundational Java session, with specific .NET comparisons and practical outcomes.

## üéØ Primary Learning Goal

**Transform your existing .NET knowledge into Java proficiency** by understanding core language differences, enterprise patterns, and modern development practices while avoiding common transition pitfalls.

## üìã Detailed Learning Objectives

### üî§ **Java Language Fundamentals**

#### **Objective 1: Master Java Syntax and Conventions**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Convert C# naming conventions to Java standards (camelCase methods, lowercase packages)
- [ ] Understand package organization vs. namespace structure
- [ ] Use import statements effectively (vs. using statements)
- [ ] Apply Java access modifiers correctly

**Why this matters:**
Java follows different conventions than C#. Understanding these early prevents bad habits and makes your code look professional to Java developers.

**Practical outcome:**
You'll be able to create properly structured Java classes that follow community standards.

**Verification:**
- Convert a C# class to Java with correct naming and organization
- Organize packages following reverse domain convention

---

#### **Objective 2: Handle Strings Safely and Effectively**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Use `.equals()` instead of `==` for string comparison
- [ ] Understand string interning and reference vs. value comparison
- [ ] Apply null-safe string operations
- [ ] Use `StringBuilder` for string concatenation

**Why this matters:**
String comparison is the #1 bug source for .NET developers learning Java. In C#, `==` is overloaded for strings; in Java, it compares references.

**Practical outcome:**
Zero string comparison bugs in your Java code.

**Verification:**
- Fix all string comparison issues in the provided anti-pattern examples
- Explain why `"hello" == new String("hello")` returns false

---

#### **Objective 3: Apply Null Safety with Optional**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Use `Optional<T>` instead of returning null
- [ ] Chain Optional operations with map, flatMap, filter
- [ ] Handle absent values gracefully with orElse, orElseThrow
- [ ] Understand when NOT to use Optional

**Why this matters:**
Java doesn't have nullable reference types like C# 8+. Optional provides explicit null handling and prevents NullPointerException.

**Practical outcome:**
Write null-safe code that clearly communicates intent about possible absence of values.

**Verification:**
- Refactor methods that return null to return Optional<T>
- Chain 3+ Optional operations without nested null checks

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **Data Structures and Collections**

#### **Objective 4: Master Java Collections Framework**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Choose appropriate collection types (ArrayList vs LinkedList vs HashSet)
- [ ] Use collection interfaces (List, Set, Map) vs. concrete classes
- [ ] Initialize collections using modern Java syntax
- [ ] Understand collection performance characteristics

**Why this matters:**
Java Collections Framework is more explicit than .NET collections. Wrong choices lead to performance issues.

**Practical outcome:**
Select optimal collections for different use cases and write efficient data manipulation code.

**Verification:**
- Implement a shopping cart using appropriate collection types
- Explain when to use ArrayList vs LinkedList with performance justification

---

#### **Objective 5: Process Data with Streams API**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Convert LINQ queries to Java Streams
- [ ] Use filter, map, reduce, collect operations effectively
- [ ] Understand stream lifecycle (single-use nature)
- [ ] Apply grouping and partitioning operations

**Why this matters:**
Streams are Java's equivalent to LINQ but with different semantics (single-use, lazy evaluation). Understanding differences prevents runtime errors.

**Practical outcome:**
Fluent data processing using functional programming patterns.

**Verification:**
- Convert 5 LINQ queries to Stream operations
- Implement grouping and aggregation using Collectors

---

### üè¢ **Enterprise Development Patterns**

#### **Objective 6: Implement Dependency Injection with Spring**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Use Spring annotations (@Service, @Repository, @Component)
- [ ] Implement constructor injection (not field injection)
- [ ] Configure Spring beans and manage lifecycle
- [ ] Understand Spring vs. .NET Core DI differences

**Why this matters:**
Spring DI works differently from Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection. Wrong patterns lead to circular dependencies and testing difficulties.

**Practical outcome:**
Create loosely coupled, testable applications using Spring's IoC container.

**Verification:**
- Build a service layer with proper dependency injection
- Explain why constructor injection is preferred over @Autowired fields

---

#### **Objective 7: Build REST APIs with Spring Boot**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Create REST controllers using Spring annotations
- [ ] Map HTTP methods to controller actions
- [ ] Handle request/response serialization
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

**Why this matters:**
Spring Boot's approach to REST differs from ASP.NET Core in annotation usage and auto-configuration.

**Practical outcome:**
Build production-ready REST APIs following Spring conventions.

**Verification:**
- Create CRUD endpoints for a domain entity
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses

---

#### **Objective 8: Write Comprehensive Tests**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Use JUnit 5 for unit testing (vs. xUnit/NUnit)
- [ ] Mock dependencies with Mockito (vs. Moq)
- [ ] Write fluent assertions with AssertJ (vs. FluentAssertions)
- [ ] Organize tests following Java conventions

**Why this matters:**
Java testing ecosystem differs from .NET in setup, assertion patterns, and mocking syntax.

**Practical outcome:**
Comprehensive test coverage using industry-standard Java testing tools.

**Verification:**
- Write unit tests for service classes with mocked dependencies
- Use AssertJ for complex object assertions

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Environment and Tools**

#### **Objective 9: Configure Maven Projects**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Understand Maven project structure and lifecycle
- [ ] Configure dependencies and plugins in pom.xml
- [ ] Use Maven commands for build, test, and package
- [ ] Compare Maven to MSBuild and NuGet

**Why this matters:**
Maven is the standard build tool for Java. Understanding its conventions and lifecycle is essential for Java development.

**Practical outcome:**
Set up and maintain Java projects using Maven following best practices.

**Verification:**
- Create a multi-module Maven project
- Configure Spring Boot starters and test dependencies

---

#### **Objective 10: Avoid Common Anti-Patterns**
**What you'll achieve:**
- [ ] Identify and fix 10 common mistakes .NET developers make
- [ ] Understand the reasoning behind Java best practices
- [ ] Apply code review skills for Java codebases
- [ ] Recognize when to use Java patterns vs. fighting them

**Why this matters:**
.NET developers often apply C# patterns inappropriately in Java, leading to bugs and non-idiomatic code.

**Practical outcome:**
Write Java code that looks natural to Java developers, not like "C# in Java syntax."

**Verification:**
- Fix all anti-pattern examples in the repository
- Review and improve Java code written by other .NET developers
